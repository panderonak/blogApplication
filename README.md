- **AppWrite**: An instance of AppWrite to manage backend functionalities.
- **Git**: Version control for managing codebase.

## Getting Started

To get this application up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/panderonak/blogApplication.git

## AppWrite Configuration

After creating an account on [AppWrite](https://appwrite.io/), follow these steps to configure the backend:

1. **Create a new project** in the AppWrite console and note down the **Project ID**.
2. **Enable authentication** and choose the desired authentication methods (e.g., email/password, OAuth).
3. **Set up the database**:
   - Create a collection called `articles` with attributes such as:
     - `Document ID`
     - `Title`
     - `Content`
     - `Status`
     - `User_ID`
   - Create a **Bucket** to store images associated with blog posts (if your app supports image uploads). Note down the **Bucket ID**.
   - Enable the necessary permissions for creating, reading, and updating posts.
4. **Configure environment variables**: Add your AppWrite `Endpoint`, `Project ID`, `Database ID`, `Collection ID`, and `Bucket ID` to your `.env` file to ensure smooth integration.
